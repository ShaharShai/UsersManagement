# React Users Management App 

## Project Description

This project is a React application that utilizes server data provided by three different endpoints:

1. [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
2. [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)
3. [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos)

The main goal of the project is to manage a "Data Base" on the client side, initialized with data retrieved from the server using the provided links. The application will have various features, such as displaying users' data, searching for users, handling additional data, updating and deleting user data, and interacting with todos and posts.
